        <div class="aboutText">
        <p>...a British/American citizen, but I've spent most of my life living in various countries around the world. I've spent the last 12 years soaking up the Scandinavian lifestyle (but not much sun, unfortunately) and I am currently studying Multimedia Design and Communication.</p>
            <br>
        <p>During this course I have gained an understanding, the knowledge and practical skills for coding, design and business.</p>
            <br>
        <p>When given the oppotunity, I love to spend time surfing. I enjoy going to the gym and I like to balance that out by cooking and eating a lot of good food. I've always had an interest in photography and videography and it's something I continuously pursue. Travel, especially backpacking, brings me a lot of joy and I'm always keen for an adventure (especially the unexpected ones).</p>
